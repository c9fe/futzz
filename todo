- add spanish
- i think chinese queries are OK but can be improved, I think we might need to iterate more times or add another metric
- turn dicts.json into {docNames:[...], values:[....]} to remove redundancy of doc name in every record
- sync indexes to disk
- create a way to do snippets (contextual snippets to put the search result in context of the document)
- create a way to do instant (basically just indexing the queries, and querying those against the current query as it is typed)
