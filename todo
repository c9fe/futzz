- add evaluation dataset
  - trying textfiles.com archives
  - try those listed here: https://github.com/RediSearch/ftsb
  - also consider https://the-eye.eu/public/AI/pile_preliminary_components/ which is also at 
    https://archive.is/wip/vgsTc
- don't pre-emptively optimise, keep the algorithm loose and open before it's thoroughly tested
- add spanish
- things we can try to improve performance:
  - the usual parameters, cover, stopping condition, score calculation,1
  - add new things like tf-idf for factors, cosine similarity (on what I don't yet know), boosting doc in (doc, query) based on how many times that doc has been the first clicked result for that query
  - joining documents across factors rather than just summing scores.
  - or summing scores, but multiplying across those factors that share a common document
- turn dicts.json into {docNames:[...], values:[....]} to remove redundancy of doc name in every record
- sync indexes to disk
- create a way to do snippets (contextual snippets to put the search result in context of the document)
- create a way to do instant (basically just indexing the queries, and querying those against the current query as it is typed)
