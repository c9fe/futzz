- get prec and rec between 70 and 80 
- snippets are important to evaluate the document
- multicore indexing (if available), which would be split across a list of documents and merge, complexity from having a shared dictionary, IPC comms?

// old
  - don't pre-emptively optimise, keep the algorithm loose and open before it's thoroughly tested
  - add spanish
  - things we can try to improve performance:
    - the usual parameters, cover, stopping condition, score calculation,1
    - add new things like tf-idf for factors, cosine similarity (on what I don't yet know), boosting doc in (doc, query) based on how many times that doc has been the first clicked result for that query
    - joining documents across factors rather than just summing scores.
    - or summing scores, but multiplying across those factors that share a common document
  - create a way to do snippets (contextual snippets to put the search result in context of the document)
  - create a way to do instant (basically just indexing the queries, and querying those against the current query as it is typed)
