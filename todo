- turn dicts.json into {docNames:[...], values:[....]} to remove redundancy of doc name in every record
- add chinese texts to tests
- consider "boosting query by also "indexing the query" against the "query doc" (max ent seems to help everything, I notice that second query is more accurate than first)
- sync indexes to disk
- create a way to do snippets (contextual snippets to put the search result in context of the document)
- create a way to do instant (basically just indexing the queries, and querying those against the current query as it is typed)
