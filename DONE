- consider "boosting query by also "indexing the query" against the "query doc" (max ent seems to help everything, I notice that second query is more accurate than first) 
  - this doesn't really work
- add a way to score results and then score the different methods we have
- add chinese texts to tests
- make index function
- improve query function
- turn indexes into real indexes

DONE !!!
