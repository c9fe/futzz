# Use Cover

Seems that we get OK results whether we use cover or not. Anecdotally results in non english language seem better without cover.

We could alternate cover and not. 

I think the better thing is to test more iterations, and a alternate (fallback) stop metric, becuase non english langauges make only 3 iterations.

Perhaps a minimum amount of entropy we need to collect in order to terminate?
